Well done on Q1 Q2 Q4 Q7 Q8 Q9 Q10

------------------------
Q3 you ask the user to enter a number thats under but dont say what number it should be under.

------------------------
Q5 You can use the or function in an if statement for all the different reds instead of all the elif statement e.g.
if c == 'red' or c == 'RED'

-------------------------
Q6 A few small mistakes here. Each time you check an option, you need to compare it to the variable, e.g.
if rain == 'yes' or rain == 'Yes'. Also, using elif on the same indent as the rain if means that once the first 
if is satisfied, the rest wonâ€™t be checked. To make the programme ask the user about wind after they answer yes to rain, 
the wind if statement should be inside the rain if statement.
e.g. 
if rain == 'yes' or rain == 'Yes':
    windy = input('Is it windy? ')
    if windy == 'yes' or windy == 'Yes':
        print('It is too windy for an umbrella')
    else:
        print('Take an umbrella')
